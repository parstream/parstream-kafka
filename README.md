# [ParStream Kafka Consumer](http://www.parstream.com)

ParStream is a massively parallel (MPP) data management system
designed to run complex analytical queries
over extremely large amounts of data on a cluster of commodity servers.

Kafka is a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service. 
It provides the functionality of a messaging system.


This ParStream Kafka Consumer can be run to read Avro or JSON data from 
a running Kafka server, decode the messages into a corresponding ParStream 
format, and stream them into a ParStream database.
